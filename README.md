# Email-Spam-Detection
In this project, we aim to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Your role is to navigate through the world of email data, employ cutting-edge techniques, and create a robust model to safeguard users from unwanted emails.

**Problem Statement:**
The constant surge in spam emails poses a significant threat, making it crucial to build an effective Email
Spam Detection System. The challenge is to utilize NLP and Machine Learning to accurately classify
incoming emails as either spam or no spam, enhancing user email experience and security.

**Your Mission:**
Develop an Intelligent Email Spam Detection System
1. NLP Techniques:
 Implement sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone within emails.
 Leverage text tokenization to break down emails into meaningful units for analysis.
 Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify entities and patterns associated with spam
content.
 Apply word embeddings to capture semantic relationships and nuances in language.
2. Machine Learning Integration:
 Harness supervised learning for model training, using a diverse dataset of labeled emails.
 Experiment with algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines for optimal
classification performance.
3. Content Analysis:
 Investigate email structures and patterns indicative of spam, such as excessive use of
hyperlinks, misleading subject lines, or irregular sender behavior.
 Implement text frequency analysis to identify recurrent spam-related terms or phrases.
4. Accuracy Enhancement:
 Fine-tune the model using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.
 Address imbalances in the dataset by employing techniques such as oversampling or
undersampling.
